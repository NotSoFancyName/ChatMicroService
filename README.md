```

The response should have this structure:
```
[  
   {
        "id": 1998,
        "serviceId": 18,
        "customerId": 6,
        "time": "1998-06-18T10:40:35",
        "fromServiceProvider": true,
        "messegeBody": "Hello, I can do any dirty job for 5$, no more and no less"
    }, 
    {
        "id": 19980,
        "serviceId": 17,
        "customerId": 6,
        "time": "2015-11-05T02:17:00",
